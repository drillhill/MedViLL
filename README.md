# Diseases Diagnosis System  
### Multi-modal Understanding and Generation for Medical Images and Text via Vision-Language Pre-Training  

This project implements the paper **"MedViLL: Multi-modal Understanding and Generation for Medical Images and Text via Vision-Language Pre-Training"** in a **Diseases Diagnosis System**. The system leverages multi-modal learning techniques to enhance the understanding and generation of medical image-text data.
